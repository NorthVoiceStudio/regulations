## Custodian: Security Dept. Confidentiality Unit

### Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive, layered protection framework for the information assets of North Voice Studio to ensure that secrets are secure, complete and available. The framework is divided into three layers: Security Layer, Abstraction Layer and Confidentiality Layer, and each layer corresponds to different information sensitivity and access control requirements.

### Security Layer: Public Information Handling Standard
#### Public Information Definition
Security Layer deals with publicly available information, including but not limited to: public press releases, announcements, event information, public reports, public research results, public member information (e.g., names and positions), etc.

#### Handling Principles
All public information must undergo strict scrutiny by relevant departments to ensure that it does not contain any sensitive or confidential content.  
Public information should be released in accordance with the Studio's public relations strategy in order to maintain the image and reputation of the Studio.  
Updates and revisions to public information should be made on a regular basis to keep the information accurate and current.

#### Mode of Dissemination
Public information may be disseminated through official websites, social media platforms, public publications, and other channels.

### Abstraction Layer: Restricted Information Handling Standard
#### Restricted Information Definition
Abstraction Layer involves internal studio information, such as internal materials, etc. Although this information does not involve core secrets, they should not be publicly disseminated to protect the Studio's internal operations and strategies.

#### Handling Principles
The handling and dissemination of information at Abstraction Layer should follow the studio's internal confidentiality policy. Information restricted for dissemination should only be passed within the Studio or between people holding specific licences and should not be made public without the permission of North Voice Studio Security Department.  
The storage and transmission of Abstraction Layer information shall take security measures such as encryption, e.g. use of internal networks, encrypted emails, encrypted document, etc.

#### Mode of Dissemination
The dissemination of Abstraction Layer information shall be carried out through secure channels such as internal networks, encrypted emails, internal document management systems, etc. to ensure the security of the information.

### Confidentiality Layer: Core Confidential Information Handling Standard
#### Core Confidential Information Definition
Confidentiality Layer involves the Studio's core confidential information, such as financial data, customer information, product design, R&D plans, strategic planning, internal audit reports, etc, which are vital to the Studio's security and interests and shall not be disclosed to the public.

#### Handling Principles
The handling and dissemination of Confidentiality Layer information should follow the strictest confidentiality policy and be limited to access by strictly authorized personnel.  
The storage and transmission of core confidential information shall be subject to the highest level of security measures, including, but not limited to, physical segregation, multi-layer encryption, access control, and security auditing.  
Access logs of confidential layer information should be recorded in detail for auditing and tracking purposes.

#### Mode of Dissemination
Dissemination of Confidentiality Layer Information shall be strictly limited and only where necessary through the most secure channels, such as internal secure networks, specialized encryption devices, etc.

### General rules for confidentiality standards

All the Studio members shall strictly abide by the above confidentiality standards, and any violation of confidentiality will be dealt with in accordance with the Studio's provisional rules for enforcing violations, including but not limited to warnings, disciplinary actions, dismissal, etc.  
The Confidentiality Team of the Security Department shall regularly review and update the confidentiality standards to adapt to the changing security environment, such as new laws and regulations, technological development, international security situation, etc.  
For information involving the Confidentiality Layer, the Security Department shall conduct regular security training to enhance members' confidentiality awareness and skills, e.g. password management, physical security, network security, etc.  
Studio's managers should review the implementation of the confidentiality standard regularly to ensure its effectiveness and compliance, such as conducting internal audits, external audits, and compliance reviews.  
The purpose of this confidentiality standard is to protect the information security of the Studio and to ensure the proper operation and strategic advantage of the Studio. All members are expected to read and comply with the above and work together to maintain the information security of the Studio.
